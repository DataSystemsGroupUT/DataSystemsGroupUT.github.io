## WELCOME TO THE PERSIST HOMEPAGE!

The focus of Project PERSIST is to analyse the role of Purchasing and Supply Management (PSM)  in the era of I4.0 (machine-to-machine communication). This underlying subject is developing in a fast pace and higher education needs to prepare for the role of new content and new forms of education. New competencies will be required and the need for new, interactive, student-centred teaching approaches is subsequent. The project members see the opportunity to benefit from the technology changes to support future education. A tailored education system will help to develop future competencies.
