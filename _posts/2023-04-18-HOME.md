## WELCOME TO THE MachineLearnAthon HOMEPAGE!

The aim of our project is the development of  MachineLearnAthons, which is a new teaching format that extends machine learning (ML) challenges. While ML challenges  are commonly designed for participants with prior ML and programming experience, the proposed MachineLearnAthons will make the ML challenges accessible for students with varying prior knowledge in ML, statistics, and programming. Thus, our project improves data literacy, hands-on knowledge of how to carry out ML projects from data collection to deployment, and the awareness of potentials and the risks of ML approaches. As students work in interdisciplinary and international teams (e.g., including diverse backgrounds, Computer Science, Business Administration, Engineering, Logistics, etc.), they also further develop their cooperation competences.
