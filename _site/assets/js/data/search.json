    "content": "Project DescriptionDue to the accelerating pace of digitalization in all aspects of life, data literacy, and ML competencies specifically areincreasingly relevant key competencies to develop trustworthy, safe, fair, accepted, and useful ML solutions for complex societal and industrial problems. ML teams must not only contain ML experts, but also people with more diverse expertise. With MachineLearnAthons, we develop a new teaching format based on ML challenges to evolve ML competencies among students with and without data science backgrounds. We address students with backgrounds in Engineering, Business Administration, or Logistics who should be endowed with the competencies to be part of interdisciplinary ML teams. Furthermore, we address Computer Science students with some knowledge in statistics, and ML who are lacking the experience of working on real-world data sets in interdisciplinary teams. Our MachineLearnAthon project will contribute to the “democratization” of ML through the proposed teaching format. We convey the necessary competencies among students (with and without programming skills) to develop ethically sound and robust ML solutions. ML challenges are at the core of our concept, because they are motivating for people who already have prior experience (Makridakis et al. 2022). However, ML challenges are hardly accessible for people without prior ML experiences and programming skills while domain expertise in ML teams is crucial to develop good ML solutions. With our new teaching concept, we will overcome these drawbacks.Our experiences show that it is a very high effort to set up good real-world challenges. There is an effort to convince companies to provide use cases and data, to anonymize and prepare the data, and to describe the use case context sufficiently detailed. Another important factor is the preparation of high-quality micro-course materials, and ML tool introduction units to make the course accessible for students with different prior knowledge in statistics, and programming. We want to use the synergies of the four partner universities to build diverse challenges, and high-quality course materials: Through the joint development in the consortium, each partner can contribute her or his own experience and use cases to the project. Due to the interdisciplinary background of our partners (Logistics, Supply Chain Management, Economics, Chemical Engineering, Computer Science), practical relevance is guaranteed.Furthermore, this project allows us to include perspectives of different domains and also countries. Finally, with this project, we want to strengthen the cooperation on the level of the teachers as well as on the level of the students. First contacts exist, which should be further developed in the axis Netherlands, Germany, Slovakia, and Estonia. Without funding, none of the goals can be reachedThe OBJECTIVE of our project is the development of the new teaching format MachineLearnAthon fulfilling the followingrequirements:      ML AWARENESS &amp; SKILLS: The format fosters the awareness of the strengths of ML, and develops competencies in the understanding, preparation, development, assessment, and implementation of ML solutions.        ML RISKS &amp; LIMITATIONS: The format fosters the understanding of the risks and limitations of ML in terms of ethical issues (e.g., discrimination of minorities, bias in data) and technical issues (e.g., extrapolation, interpretability, robustness).        DATA LITERACY: The format develops data literacy of students in general; data literacy is the ability (of non-data scientists) to deal with data in a planned manner (GI 2018).        INTERDISCIPLINARY &amp; INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION: The format develops competencies necessary for joint project work in interdisciplinary and international teams; it prevents discrimination of students with no ML knowledge an increases the appreciation of the necessary domain expertise.        ACTION ORIENTED: MachineLearnAthon is activating and motivating. Also, it fosters self-learning and contains use cases and data sets relevant to the students’ domains following the principles of project-based learning (Düdder 2021a).  CONCRETE RESULTS:The core of MachineLearnAthons are ML challenges, i.e., use cases and corresponding data sets.In contrast to challenges currently published on platforms such as kaggle.com, our format contains:(1) DIFFERENT DIFFICULTY LEVELS: Difficulty levels for the tasks of the use cases to also include students with no or low prior knowledge in the context of ML, but with domain expertise.(2) PRE-CHALLENGE MICRO LECTURES: A collection of video lectures introducing basics about statistics, and ML to accommodate for unequal starting conditions and to provide a common language for students from different study programs and countries.(3) ML TOOL INTRODUCTION UNITS: Material to introduce different ML tools ranging from state-of-the-art programming libraries (e.g., for Python, Java), over ML tools with a graphical user interface (e.g., KNIME), up to AutoML tools (e.g., AutoWeka) with open source focus.(4) COURSE INTERNAL LEADERBOARDS: A system evaluating and showing the current results of all teams of the course and their development over time; internal leaderboards reduce the barrier for the participation of novices.(5) OPEN ONLINE DATA GENERATORS: Besides open static real-world data sets (as common in ML challenges), we provide simulation models of real-world systems generating online data; this allows to teach the whole process from datacollection to model deployment and online analysis.PRIORITIES:MachineLearnAthons address the development of digital readiness, resilience, and capacity of our students. By its didactically founded components, it will stimulate innovative learning and teaching practices. With specialized offers, we will encourage and promote female students."

    "content": "WELCOME TO THE MachineLearnAthon HOMEPAGE!The aim of our project is the development of  MachineLearnAthons, which is a new teaching format that extends machine learning (ML) challenges. While ML challenges  are commonly designed for participants with prior ML and programming experience, the proposed MachineLearnAthons will make the ML challenges accessible for students with varying prior knowledge in ML, statistics, and programming. Thus, our project improves data literacy, hands-on knowledge of how to carry out ML projects from data collection to deployment, and the awareness of potentials and the risks of ML approaches. As students work in interdisciplinary and international teams (e.g., including diverse backgrounds, Computer Science, Business Administration, Engineering, Logistics, etc.), they also further develop their cooperation competences."
